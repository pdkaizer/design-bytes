# design bytes

Articles live in `articles/` as Markdown; images live in `images/`.

## Writing

```sh
npm start        # opens the writer at http://localhost:4321
```

- Everything autosaves to `articles/<name>.md`, so you can keep using git or VS Code alongside it. If a file changes on disk while you're editing, the writer asks which version to keep.
- Paste, drop or pick an image and it's saved to `images/` and inserted as `![](../images/…)`.
- Write / Split / Preview views, focus mode, light & dark themes, three editor fonts.
- The status bar shows word count, reading time, and writing suggestions (links pasted twice, repeated words, extra spaces).
- Deleted articles go to `articles/.trash/`.

## Publishing

```sh
npm run build    # renders every article to dist/ (index + one page per article)
```

"Download as HTML" in the ⋯ menu exports a single, self-contained article with its images embedded.

## Under the hood

No dependencies — just Node 18+.

- `editor/lib/markdown.js` — the Markdown renderer, shared by the browser and the build
- `editor/server.js` — local server and file API (listens on 127.0.0.1 only)
- `editor/build.js` — static site build
- `editor/public/` — the editor UI; `article.css` is used by both the preview and published pages
- `npm test` — renderer tests
